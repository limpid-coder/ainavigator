Legend: "Top 3 (Lowest scores)" ❌ Confusing
```

### After (Business):
```
┌─────────┐
│  2.96   │  ← Clear: approaching 3.0 = concerning

│    ✨   │  ← Interactive solutions available
└─────────┘
Scale: 2-4 (full range utilized)
Legend: "⚠ Priority - Focus here" ✅ Clear

## 💼 Executive Summary

**For Your Stakeholders:**

> "We surveyed 1,000 employees about AI adoption. Scores range from 2-4, where 2 means they're ready and 4 means critical concerns. Our overall average is 2.64 - that's moderate concerns that are manageable. We have one priority area at 3.24 that needs immediate attention (red cell), and a few areas around 2.8-3.0 that need improvement (orange cells). Our green cells show we're strong in several areas and ready to build on those."

**No statistics, no jargon, just actionable insights!** ✅
