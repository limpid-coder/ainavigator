# ✨ Simplified & Refined - Final Polish

## 🎯 What Changed

### Removed (Too Much):
- ❌ Mini nav (redundant with sidebar)
- ❌ Bottom-right quick commands button (moved to header)
- ❌ Over-the-top animations on some elements
- ❌ Excessive borders and shadows
- ❌ Unnecessary outlines

### Added/Refined:
- ✅ **Clean search bar in header** - Integrated naturally
- ✅ **Subtle borders** - More elegant, less harsh
- ✅ **Simplified active states** - Clean teal background instead of gradients
- ✅ **Better visual flow** - Elements breathe, don't compete
- ✅ **Polished theme toggle** - Smooth rotate animation

## 🎨 Visual Refinements

### Borders:
**Before:** Multiple border colors, thick outlines, shadows everywhere
**After:** Subtle `border-slate-200/60` with reduced opacity, clean and minimal

### Active States:
**Before:** `bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-500/15 to-purple-500/10 border border-teal-500/30 shadow-sm shadow-teal-500/10`
**After:** `bg-teal-50 dark:bg-teal-500/10 text-teal-700 dark:text-teal-400`
